- allow only one-hop pointer dereference
  + e.g., a->b->c  =>  f(a->b, &(f(a, &(a->b))->c))
    - crash in a->b access
  + SOLVED

- typedef cannot be pointcutted
  + e.g., typedef of struct, atomic_t

- primitive type cannot be pointcutted
  + difficult to distinguish

- need the name for anonymous nested struct
  + e.g., struct "struct_xxx" { ... } xxx;

- array size is unknown
  + resulttype()
  + needs to obtain type size (e.g., upid)

- p->tasks is copied by using aspect?
  + semantically no problem when no writes

- C++ keywords
  + private -> _private
  + class -> _class
  + catch -> _catch

- utils.c cannot be weaved
  + why?

- process's memory access?

- remove "const" struct task_struct in arg

- &a->b->c->d => __get(obj, &((obj = (&a->b->c))->d))
  + a->b->c fails
  + &(a->b->c->d) avoids the problem

- dom number in aspect

- disallow the same name function as struct name

- char * member should be dereferenced?
  + often used as string
